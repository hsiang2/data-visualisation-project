    <h2>1. Project Background and Objectives</h2>
    <p>This project is based on the simulated post-earthquake emergency response in the city of St. Himark. By conducting in-depth analysis of disaster reports submitted by residents, we aim to provide data-driven support for government departments in rescue coordination and resource allocation.</p>
    <p>The analysis focuses on three core tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1）Formulating Emergency Response Recommendations:</strong> By evaluating the severity of disasters across different communities, the project identifies the most severely affected areas to guide the prioritization of emergency resources and personnel deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>2）Uncertainty Analysis of Reported Data:</strong> Based on assessments of data completeness and consistency, a reliability score is proposed for each community's reports, enabling decision-makers to gauge data credibility and avoid misjudgments caused by erroneous inputs.</li>
        <li><strong>3）Temporal Evolution of Disaster Severity:</strong> Using time series analysis techniques, the project investigates the temporal dynamics of the disaster, identifies the mainshock and aftershock periods, and provides insights to inform phased emergency response strategies.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Data Missingness Handling and Cleaning Strategy</h2>
    <p>To ensure the reliability of data analysis, this project adopts differentiated approaches for handling missing values based on the characteristics and missing rates of each field, as detailed below:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>1） Creating Indicator Variables:</strong> For fields with a high proportion of missing values, such as <code>medical</code>, a Boolean variable <code>medical_reported</code> is introduced, where a value of 1 indicates a valid report and 0 indicates missing data. This approach retains the significance of missingness while allowing the variable to be explicitly considered in subsequent analyses.</li>
        <li><strong>2） Median Imputation by Community:</strong> For the field <code>shake_intensity</code>, which exhibits a moderate level of missingness and structural differences across communities, median imputation is applied separately within each community.</li>
        <li><strong>3） Global Median Imputation:</strong> For fields with very low missing rates, such as <code>buildings</code> and <code>sewer_and_water</code>, global median values are used for imputation to avoid introducing significant bias.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This cleaning strategy strikes a balance between preserving the integrity of the original data and enhancing completeness, laying a solid foundation for subsequent modeling and visualization.</p>
        

    <h2>3. Data Reliability Analysis</h2>
    <p>The following section presents visualizations of reliability scores across different communities:</p>
    <p><strong> Ordered by location:</strong></p>
    <canvas id="reliabilityChart1" height="300"></canvas>
    <p><strong> Ordered by score magnitude:</strong></p>
    <canvas id="reliabilityChart2" height="300"></canvas>
    <p>Each community (Location) is assigned a "data reliability score." Taller bars indicate that the community has submitted more reports with lower missing rates, implying more complete information and higher data credibility. Shorter bars suggest fewer reports or higher missing rates, indicating that caution should be exercised when referencing data from these communities. Notably, Community 3 stands out with significantly higher data quality compared to others, whereas Communities 7, 13, and 17 received relatively low scores and should be considered carefully in decision-making processes.</p>
    <div id="heatmapChart" height="300"></div>
    <p><strong>Overall data quality:</strong> For most communities and the majority of indicators, data completeness is very high, suggesting that the information can be reliably used for disaster assessment and decision-making.<br>
    <strong>Missing critical indicators:</strong> In some communities, key fields such as <code>roads_and_bridges</code> or <code>sewer_and_water</code> are almost entirely unreported, introducing uncertainty in assessing the true disaster impact. Additional investigation or on-site confirmation may be required to prevent overlooking actual conditions.<br>
    <strong>Uneven reporting of seismic intensity:</strong> The completeness rate of <code>shake_intensity</code> varies significantly across communities, indicating that some communities actively reported detailed seismic information, while others submitted very few or no entries, making it difficult to accurately evaluate the level of ground shaking in those regions.</p>

    <h2>4. Analysis of Missing Data Rates Over Time</h2>
    <p>We selected six key disaster-related indicators (power, medical, roads_and_bridges, buildings, shake_intensity, sewer_and_water) and plotted the trend of their missing data rates over time.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Stable fields:</strong> The missing rates for <code>buildings</code> and <code>sewer_and_water</code> consistently remained below 5% with minimal fluctuation, indicating a stable reporting pattern.</li>
    <li><strong>Volatile fields:</strong> The missing rates for <code>power</code>, <code>roads_and_bridges</code>, and <code>medical</code> spiked noticeably during the mainshock and aftershock periods, suggesting that infrastructure disruptions may have impaired reporting capabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Case in point:</strong> Around 03:00 on April 8, the missing rate for <code>medical</code> surged to 0.42, which aligns with a likely breakdown of the hospital reporting systems immediately following the earthquake.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>5. Temporal Trend Analysis of Individual Indicators</h2>
<p>We conducted a focused analysis on the hourly trends of <code>power</code> and <code>buildings</code>, visualized alongside the number of submitted reports.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first peak occurred in the early hours of April 8, corresponding to the mainshock event.</li>
    <li>The second, smaller peak appeared on the morning of April 9, possibly indicating an aftershock or delayed reporting effect.</li>
    <li>The mean value of <code>power</code> rose to 6.8 before gradually declining; simultaneously, <code>buildings</code> exhibited a marked increase, trending in parallel with <code>shake_intensity</code>.</li>
</ul>

    <p>The severity trends of two disaster indicators, <code>power</code> and <code>buildings</code>, were compared over the period from April 6 to April 9. Overall, these two curves exhibit synchronous or closely aligned fluctuations at certain time points. Periods with high values indicate relatively severe disaster impact, while low-value intervals suggest partial recovery or reduced damage. Notably, both indicators showed a significant surge around April 8, suggesting that the mainshock severely affected both the power infrastructure and buildings.</p>

    <h2>6. Multi-Indicator Global Trend and Disaster Evolution Chart</h2>
    <p><strong>A number of disaster indicators (power, buildings, road and water damage, shake intensity) and the number of citizen reports</strong> are plotted together on the same timeline, with points in time between the main shock and aftershocks. It can be seen:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There is a <strong>significant peak</strong>  in all types of disaster indicators and the number of reports <strong>around 8 April</strong>, corresponding to the severe damage and concentration of reports due to the main earthquake.</li>
        <li>There are also relatively significant fluctuations during the <strong>aftershock period</strong>, but the magnitude is usually smaller than that of the mainshock.</li>
        <li>Different indicators show different trends of rising, falling or sustained high levels before and after the earthquake, suggesting that the extent of damage and recovery in various areas are not entirely synchronised.</li>

    <h2>7. Analysis of Individual Indicators: Power, Shaking & Correlation</h2>
    <h3>Electricity Damage Across Communities</h3>
    <p>
        There are clear differences in the severity of power problems between communities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communities 3, 7, and 11</strong> face the most severe issues (avg. 7-8).</li>
        <li><strong>Communities like 19</strong> report milder impacts.</li>
        <li>These gaps suggest that recovery efforts should prioritise the hardest-hit areas.</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="chart8-1" style="width: 100%; height: 450px;"></div>

    <h3>Earthquake Intensity Variability Within Communities</h3>
    <p>
        This box plot highlights shaking intensity reports in five high-impact communities (3, 7, 4, 12, 18):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Median values (horizontal lines in boxes)</strong><br>
            Community 3 had the highest median (~5), while Community 18 was lower (~3), but all fall within the high-intensity category.</li>
        <li><strong>Variability (box and whisker range)</strong><br>
            All communities showed wide internal variation, with values ranging from about 1 to 9.</li>
        <li><strong>Outliers (dots)</strong><br>
            Each community had reports above 8, showing the presence of extreme individual experiences.</li>
    </ul>

    <div id="chart8-2" style="width: 100%; height: 450px;"></div>
    <h3>Relationship Between Earthquake Intensity and Power Issues</h3>
    <p>
        This 2D histogram shows how reported shaking intensity (x-axis) relates to the severity of power issues (y-axis), with brighter colours indicating more frequent report combinations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Most frequent range</strong><br>
            Reports are concentrated in the moderate shaking (2–4) and moderate power issues (3–5) range, suggesting these often co-occur.</li>
        <li><strong>High-intensity cases</strong><br>
            At high shaking levels (>7), the severity of power issues varies widely. Such cases are less common, possibly due to the rarity of extreme events or underreporting.</li>
        <li><strong>No clear trend</strong><br>
            The distribution does not follow a strong diagonal pattern, indicating that stronger shaking does not necessarily lead to more severe power issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Comprehensive Disaster Severity Scoring (Unweighted & Weighted)</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        This visualisation displays the severity scores of different communities based on multiple disaster indicators.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communities 3 and 7</strong> stand out with the highest severity scores, indicating more severe and widespread damage. These areas should be prioritised for emergency response and resource allocation.</li>
        <li><strong>Community 6</strong>and other communities on the right side show lower scores, suggesting relatively minor damage and lower urgency for large-scale aid.</li>
        <li><strong>The remaining communities</strong> fall in between and vary in severity. Resource allocation can be planned according to their ranking.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Weighted Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
        After adjusting the weights of each indicator, the severity scores are recalculated.
        We prioritised power and building damage by setting their weights to 2.0, followed by roads & bridges and medical services at 1.5, and finally water systems and shake intensity at 1.0.
        This helps reflect more realistic priorities when planning rescue and support efforts.

    <h2>9. Nuclear Power Plant Region Specialized Analysis (Location 4)</h2>
    <p>
        Between 6 and 9 April, both power issues (red line) and shaking intensity (green line) in the nuclear power plant area fluctuated frequently, but not always synchronously. Summary:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Frequent Power Fluctuations</strong><br>
            Power problems peaked at certain times (e.g., morning of 6 April, around 8 April), which could be due to repeated outages, repairs, or delayed reporting.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Shaking and Power Not Always Aligned</strong><br>
            Although shaking intensity also peaked, it did not always coincide with the timing of power issues. This suggests that other factors, such as equipment age or network vulnerability, may have contributed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>High-Risk Area</strong><br>
            The nuclear power plant supplies 72% of the city’s electricity. Any instability here can have significant consequences, highlighting the need for stronger monitoring and more resources for emergency response.

    <h2>10.Results</h2>
    <h3>Q1: Emergency responders will base their initial response on the earthquake shake map. Use visual analytics to determine how their response should change based on damage reports from citizens on the ground. How would you prioritize neighborhoods for response? Which parts of the city are hardest hit?</h3>
    <p>A1: By setting appropriate weights, users can determine the response priority for different communities based on the color intensity displayed on the Fig. "Disaster Severity Map by Community" ; darker colors indicate higher priority. This assessment is made more intuitive when viewed alongside the ranked order presented in the Fig. "Bar Chart of Disaster Severity Scores by Community" . According to the initially suggested weights, the resulting priority order for community response is as follows: 3, 8, 7, 10, 9, 14, 11, 18, 4, 1, 12, 17, 13, 2, 16, 15, 5, 19, 6.</p>

    <h3>Q2: Use visual analytics to show uncertainty in the data. Compare the reliability of neighborhood reports. Which neighborhoods are providing reliable reports? Provide a rationale for your response.</h3>
    <p>A2: With the introduction of reliability scores, the reliability ranking of each community can be observed on the Fig. "Bar chart of data reliability scores for each community" . For example, reports from location 3 are shown to be comparatively the most reliable. Furthermore, the Fig. "Heatmap of the completeness rate of each indicator in each community" reveals that, compared to other communities, location 7 exhibits significantly more missing data across various indicators, which consequently results in its lowest reliability score.</p>

    <h3>Q3: How do conditions change over time? How does uncertainty in change over time? Describe the key changes you see.</h3>
    <p>A3: The Fig. "Line Chart of Hourly Report Counts for All Communities" indicates that three distinct seismic events (earthquakes) occurred within the observed timeframe. The patterns suggest the second event was the strongest in intensity, while the first was the weakest. Furthermore, anomalies in the report volumes following the second and third earthquakes suggest that some communities experienced one or two instances of power disruption during these periods.</p>
    <p>The Fig. "Changes in the Missing Rate of Each Indicator Over Time chart" illustrates the temporal variation in missing data rates for each indicator. It can be observed that the missing rate for <code>shake_intensity</code> significantly decreases in the periods immediately following seismic events, suggesting that residents are more likely to report this specific indicator after experiencing an earthquake. The missing rates for <code>buildings</code> and <code>sewer_and_water</code> consistently remained below 5% with minimal fluctuation, indicating a stable reporting pattern.</p>
    <p>The Fig. "Multi-Indicator Disaster Trend & Report Evolution visualization" shows: There is a significant peak in all types of disaster indicators and the number of reports around 8 April, corresponding to the severe damage and concentration of reports due to the main earthquake. There are also relatively significant fluctuations during the aftershock period, but the magnitude is usually smaller than that of the mainshock.</p>

    <h2>11. Other Findings and Future Improvements</h2>
    <h3>Findings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Severely Affected Areas: </strong>
            It shows significant fluctuations in power issues at Location 4 (nuclear power plant). Power system fluctuations pose a risk of city-wide blackouts. Monitoring should be strengthened and dedicated repair teams deployed, with continuous communication maintained with the plant’s operational departments.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Quality Variance: </strong>
            While most community data is complete, some areas have high reporting gaps in roads, water, and medical services,  leading to uncertainty.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Time-Series Characteristics: </strong>
            Reports peaked around April 8, clearly reflecting the main earthquake and aftershock periods.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Handling Potential Collective Exaggeration:</strong><br>The issue of potential "collective exaggerated reporting" was not adequately addressed. As noted in related documentation (VAST 2019 - St. Himark - About Our City.docx), location 8, despite being relatively distant from the epicenter, reported higher damage levels than many closer locations. Considering the context that 'Many of the city’s elite and powerful call Scenic Vista [Location 8] home,' one hypothesis is that affluent residents may have a lower tolerance for damage, leading to subjectively inflated or non-objective reporting. This potential bias was not effectively isolated or adjusted for in our analysis. Significant time and effort were invested in exploring this, including analysing correlation coefficients and data variance, but these approaches did not yield satisfactory results in clearly distinguishing or explaining the anomalous reporting pattern of location 8.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Reliability Score Limitations:</strong><br>The current reliability score, based solely on the average missing data rate per community, is limited in its scope and may not adequately capture the complexities of real-world data trustworthiness. Future iterations should consider additional dimensions (such as data variance, temporal consistency, or cross-validation with other sources) to create a more comprehensive and representative scoring system, thus improving its overall accuracy and applicability.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Handling Delayed Reporting:</strong><br>The analysis could not account for reporting delays caused by power outages. Several communities experienced periods with zero reports followed by a surge upon power restoration. It was impossible to determine the intended original submission times for these delayed reports. Access to additional information (e.g., outage duration, device offline times) that could allow for the temporal adjustment of these delayed reports would significantly reduce data noise and interference, thereby further enhancing the accuracy and practical utility of the analysis for decision support.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Basic Visualization Techniques:</strong><br>The types of visualizations employed in the current system are relatively foundational. Future enhancements could explore the use of more advanced visualization libraries or techniques to create more sophisticated and potentially more insightful interactive displays.
